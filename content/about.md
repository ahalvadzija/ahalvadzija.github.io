I bridge the gap between **low-level engineering logic** and high-level architectural design. With a foundation in Systems Engineering, I bring a rigorous, analytical approach to modern software development.

My journey from a certified IT Technician to a **Software Engineer** is rooted in my academic studies of Computer Science. Currently, I am focused on mastering the **Java ecosystem** to build scalable, enterprise-grade backends.
